# Golden Retriever Puppy Training Guide: Positive Reinforcement from Day One

Golden Retrievers are eager to please and quick to learn, which makes them a joy to train when you use positive, consistent methods. This guide covers housebreaking, basic commands, socialization, and how to set your puppy up for a lifetime of good behavior.

## Core Principles

- **Positive reinforcement** – Reward what you like (treats, praise, play); ignore or redirect what you don’t.
- **Consistency** – Same cues, same rules, and the whole family on the same page.
- **Short sessions** – Puppies have short attention spans; 5–10 minutes several times a day beats one long session.

## Housebreaking

1. **Schedule** – Take your puppy out after waking, eating, playing, and every 1–2 hours.
2. **Same spot** – Use one area in the yard so the smell cues them.
3. **Reward immediately** – Treat and praise the moment they finish outside.
4. **Clean accidents well** – Use an enzymatic cleaner like our [Training essentials](/products?category=Training) to remove odor so they don’t re-soil.

## Basic Commands (Sit, Stay, Come)

- **Sit** – Lure with a treat over the nose, reward when bottom hits the floor.
- **Stay** – Start with 1 second, then build duration and distance.
- **Come** – Use a long line at first; reward every time they reach you. High-value treats help – see [Food/Treats](/products?category=Food/Treats).

Keep sessions fun and end on a success. For more structure, pair with a good book or our [Puppy Care guide](/guides/puppy-care) for health and routine.

## Socialization

Expose your puppy safely to people, dogs, sounds, and surfaces. Avoid overwhelming them; let them approach at their pace. Well-socialized Goldens grow into confident, friendly adults.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Punishing accidents after the fact (they won’t connect it).
- Inconsistent rules (e.g., allowing jumping sometimes).
- Skipping socialization or pushing too fast.

## Final Thought

Training is an ongoing conversation with your Golden. Stay patient, reward often, and enjoy the process.

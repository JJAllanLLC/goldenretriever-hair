# Golden Retriever Puppy Care Guide: Health, Schedule, and First-Year Basics

The first year with a Golden Retriever puppy sets the foundation for a healthy, well-adjusted adult. This guide covers feeding, sleep, vet visits, teething, and daily care so you can focus on bonding instead of guessing.

## Feeding Your Puppy

- **Puppy formula** – Use a quality large-breed puppy food to support steady growth. Our [Food & Treats](/products?category=Food/Treats) page includes options we trust.
- **Portions** – Follow the bag by weight and age; your vet can adjust for your pup’s condition.
- **Meal schedule** – Three meals a day until around 6 months, then two. Avoid free-feeding to help with housebreaking and [training](/guides/puppy-training).

## Sleep and Crate Training

- Puppies need lots of sleep (18–20 hours a day). A crate or pen gives them a safe, quiet place to rest.
- Make the crate positive: treats, meals, and calm time inside. See [Essentials](/products?category=Essentials) for crates and beds that last.

## Vet Schedule (First Year)

- **Vaccinations** – Follow your vet’s plan (typically a series over the first few months).
- **Deworming and preventives** – Discuss flea, tick, and heartworm prevention; we use and recommend options in [Health](/products?category=Health).
- **Spay/neuter** – Your vet will recommend timing; many suggest waiting until growth is mostly complete for large breeds.

## Teething and Chewing

- Provide safe chew toys to redirect biting. Durable options are in our [Toys](/products?category=Toys) picks.
- Frozen washcloths or approved chews can soothe gums. Never leave puppies unsupervised with items that can break or be swallowed.

## Grooming Early

- Get them used to brushing, nail trims, and gentle handling. It makes [grooming](/guides/golden-retriever-grooming-guide) much easier as adults. Start with short, positive sessions.

## Final Thought

Puppyhood is intense but fleeting. A consistent routine, good nutrition, and positive training pay off for years.

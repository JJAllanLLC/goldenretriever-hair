# The Great Chicken Cutlet Heist: My Golden Retriever's Most Epic Counter-Surfing Crime

If you own a Golden Retriever, you already know: **never turn your back on raw meat**. Ever.

I was in full dinner-prep mode — chicken cutlets sliced thin, pounded perfectly, stacked high on the cutting board like a delicious tower of temptation. All I needed was the breadcrumbs from the cabinet behind me. One quick spin, reach up... and in that split second?

**Swoosh.**

I turn back and Cosmo — my sweet, innocent-looking Golden — has his entire head on the counter, jaws clamped around the **whole stack**. Not one cutlet. Not two. The entire pile. Gone in a flash. He didn't even chew — just inhaled them like a furry vacuum cleaner and trotted off with that classic Golden grin, tail wagging like he'd just won the lottery.

I stood there frozen, staring at an empty cutting board, yelling "COSMO!" while he casually swallowed the evidence in the living room. Raw chicken and all. (Vet emergency call followed immediately — thankfully he was fine, but my blood pressure was not.)

## Why Goldens Are Master Thieves

It's not malice. It's pure opportunity + instinct. Goldens were bred to retrieve game birds gently in their mouths, so a stack of thin chicken slices? Basically a gift from the universe in their minds.

A few other Cosmo classics for context:
- The Thanksgiving turkey carving incident (he waited patiently until I stepped away for gravy — half the breast disappeared).
- The pizza box on the coffee table — lifted the entire lid with his nose and helped himself to three slices before I noticed.
- The "butter stick disappearance" of 2024 — found the empty wrapper under the couch and one very shiny-mouthed dog.

If this sounds familiar, you're not alone. Every Golden owner has a counter-surfing war story.

## How to Survive (and Maybe Prevent) the Next Heist

After the Great Cutlet Caper, I got serious about management. Here are my hard-won tips:

- **Elevated feeders and counters**: Keep food prep out of reach. I swear by [this raised feeding station from my Products page](/products?category=Essentials) — it trains them that food only comes from certain spots.
- **Redirection bribes**: Keep healthy, high-value treats nearby to trade. Cosmo now gets a frozen Kong or [these salmon treats](/products?category=Food/Treats) when I'm cooking — way better than raw chicken drama.
- **Portion control is your friend**: Goldens will eat until the world ends. If yours is a thief like Cosmo, proper feeding schedules and weight checks are crucial — check out my full **[Nutrition & Feeding Guide](/guides/nutrition)** for life-stage portions and tips to avoid obesity.
- **Puzzle toys for bored thieves**: Mental stimulation cuts down on opportunistic crime. A stuffed Toppl or snuffle mat keeps them busy while you cook.

## Final Thought

Years later, I still laugh about the cutlet heist (and Cosmo still scans every counter hopefully). These moments are why we love them — the chaos, the joy, the unconditional "I stole your dinner but I love you" vibe.

## The Chicken Cutlet Heist: My Golden's Epic Counter-Surfing Crime

If you own a Golden Retriever, you already know: **never turn your back on raw meat**. Ever.

I was in full dinner-prep mode — chicken cutlets sliced thin, pounded perfectly, stacked high on the cutting board like a delicious tower of temptation. All I needed was the breadcrumbs from the cabinet behind me. One quick spin, reach up... and in that split second?

**Swoosh.**

I turn back and Cosmo — my sweet, innocent-looking Golden — has his entire head on the counter, jaws clamped around the **whole stack**. Not one cutlet. Not two. The entire pile. Gone in a flash. He didn't even chew — just inhaled them like a furry vacuum cleaner and trotted off with that classic Golden grin, tail wagging like he'd just won the lottery.

I stood there frozen, staring at an empty cutting board, yelling "COSMO!" while he casually swallowed the evidence in the living room. Raw chicken and all. (Vet emergency call followed immediately — thankfully he was fine, but my blood pressure was not.)

## Why Goldens Are Master Thieves

It's not malice. It's pure opportunity + instinct. Goldens were bred to retrieve game birds gently in their mouths, so a stack of thin chicken slices? Basically a gift from the universe in their minds.

A few other Cosmo classics for context:
- The Thanksgiving turkey carving incident (he waited patiently until I stepped away for gravy — half the breast disappeared).
- The pizza box on the coffee table — lifted the entire lid with his nose and helped himself to three slices before I noticed.
- The "butter stick disappearance" of 2024 — found the empty wrapper under the couch and one very shiny-mouthed dog.

If this sounds familiar, you're not alone. Every Golden owner has a counter-surfing war story.

## How to Survive (and Maybe Prevent) the Next Heist

After the Great Cutlet Caper, I learned the hard truth: Goldens are wired for food, and counter-surfing is one of the toughest habits to break. Cosmo still gives the counter "the look" every time I cook, but we've turned epic thefts into rare slip-ups with consistent training and management.

The reality? Full prevention is tough — that food drive is strong — but you can make it manageable:

- **Teach "Leave It" and "Drop It" early and often**: These commands saved us. Start with low-value items and build up — reward heavily for success. Positive reinforcement works wonders on eager-to-please Goldens. My full **[Training Guide](/guides/puppy-training)** has step-by-step for these (and other boundaries like calm greetings).
- **Set clear boundaries with "Place" or "Off"**: Train a solid "go to your place" (mat or bed) during meal prep. Pair with high-value rewards to make it more appealing than the counter. Cosmo's "place" is his safe zone now.
- **Management as backup**: Even with training, keep temptations out of reach. I rely on [this raised feeding station](/products?category=Essentials) to reinforce "food only from approved spots," and keep [these salmon treats](/products?category=Food/Treats) handy for redirection.
- **Portion control and mental stimulation**: Overfeeding fuels the drive — check my **[Nutrition & Feeding Guide](/guides/nutrition)** for schedules. Puzzle toys (like a stuffed Toppl) burn energy and reduce boredom snacking.

Training takes time and consistency, but it's worth it. Cosmo's still a hopeful thief at heart, but the big heists are history. Management + positive training = fewer gray hairs for us humans.

## Final Thought

Years later, I still laugh about the cutlet heist (and Cosmo still scans every counter hopefully). These moments are why we love them — the chaos, the joy, the unconditional "I stole your dinner but I love you" vibe.

P.S. If you're dealing with food obsession or weight issues after a heist, head over to the **[Nutrition & Feeding Guide](/guides/nutrition)** — it's packed with vet-approved advice and my personal food recommendations.

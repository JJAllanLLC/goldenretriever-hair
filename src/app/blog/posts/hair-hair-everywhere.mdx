When many of us first bring home a Golden puppy, we think we've lucked out. "Wow, this puppy barely sheds!" As they grow, it still seems manageable – maybe our Golden just isn't a heavy shedder. Then adulthood hits, and any illusion of a low-shed breed goes right out the window. Shedding season? With Goldens, it's pretty much year-round – and it's often the biggest (and maybe only) downside of these amazing dogs.

But don't worry – with the right approach, you can keep the fur under control and your Golden looking their best.

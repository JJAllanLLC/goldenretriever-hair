# Hair, Hair Everywhere: Surviving Golden Retriever Shedding Season

Let's be honest – if you own a Golden Retriever, you know the struggle. Fur on the couch, fur in your coffee, fur on your black pants the second you walk out the door. It's like living with a walking tumbleweed factory!

Shedding season never really ends with Goldens – but there are ways to make it manageable (and keep your home from looking like a fur explosion).

## Tips That Save Your Sanity (and Vacuum)
- Brush daily (or at least 3x/week) – outside if possible!
- Use the right tools – check our [recommended grooming products](/products?category=Grooming)

## Diet & Supplements for Healthier Coats
- Omega-3s can help reduce excessive shedding

Grooming reminders coming in the upcoming [Golden Week app](/golden-week) – join the waitlist so you never miss a brush session!

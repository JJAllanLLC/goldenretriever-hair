When many of us first bring home a Golden puppy, we think we've lucked out. "Wow, this puppy barely sheds!" As they grow, it still seems manageable – maybe our Golden just isn't a heavy shedder. Then adulthood hits, and any illusion of a low-shed breed goes right out the window. Shedding season? With Goldens, it's pretty much year-round – and it's often the biggest (and maybe only) downside of these amazing dogs.

But don't worry – with the right approach, you can keep the fur under control and your Golden looking their best.

## Tips That Save Your Sanity (and Vacuum)

1. 🐾 Brush daily (or at least 3x/week) – outside if possible!
2. 🐾 Keep a lint roller in every room (and your car) – quick fur fixes for clothes/couch before guests arrive.
3. 🐾 Groom outside whenever possible – let Mother Nature handle the cleanup (and give your vacuum a break).
4. 🐾 Use the right tools – check our [recommended grooming products](/products?category=Grooming)
5. 🐾 Cover furniture with washable throws – easy to shake out or toss in the laundry when fur takes over.
6. 🐾 Schedule "fur patrol" walks – brushing before/after keeps loose hair outside instead of on your floors.
7. 🐾 Try a fur-catching dryer sheet on upholstery – static magic pulls hair right off.
8. 🐾 Keep a dedicated "Golden zone" with easy-clean floors – saves sanity in high-traffic shedding areas.
10. 🐾 Accept some fur as "Golden glitter" – it's part of the package, but these tricks make it manageable!

## Diet & Supplements for Healthier Coats

Omega-3s can help reduce excessive shedding.

- 🐾 High-quality salmon-based food – real fish for coat health and fewer allergies.
- 🐾 Sweet potato treats – beta-carotene for coat color and health.
- 🐾 Balanced adult formula with real meat first – avoids fillers that can worsen shedding.
